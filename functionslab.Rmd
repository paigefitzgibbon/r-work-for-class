##  <span style="color:blue"> A bit more on Looping <\span>

Loops can be "nested" on loop in side the other

Exampe: Calculate NPV or a range of different interest rates and a range of damages that may be incurred 10 years in the future

Steps

* define inputs (interest rates, damages)
* define output (NPV)
* write the function
* create a data structure to store results where we vary both interest rates and damages
* use nest for loops to fill in the data structure

```{r npvfor, echo=FALSE}

# write a function to compute npv
source("compute_NPV.R")
compute_NPV(20, discount=0.01, time=20)
source("mynpv.R")
mynpv(interest=0.01,value=20,time=20)

#generate some input
damages = c(25,33,91,24)
# sensitivity to discount rate
discount_rates = seq(from=0.01, to=0.04, by=0.005)
yr=10

##if you want to find discount rates from this range of 0.01 to 0.04 by 0.005, you can use this function to compute your npv for all discount rates. then you can use nested for loops to keep calling function for all different values in sequence. it'll give you a different NVP for evert possible damage & every possible discount rate

#you define each for loop

# compute some npv's for different discount rates
# first generate a dataframe to store results
npvs = as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=length(damages), ncol=length(discount_rates)))

# now use a for loop to populate
 for (i in 1:length(damages)) {
         for (j in 1:length(discount_rates)) {
       npvs[i,j]= compute_NPV(value=damages[i],       discount=discount_rates[j],time=yr )

         }
 }
 npvs
 #in this case, she defined the first for loop as i in 1 length(damages) and the second for loop specifies j as length discount rate. this names rows damages and the columns as discount. then, you can use [i and j] to call specific values in the x and y. its not really dimensions its more just vectors and in this case we are indexing them as x and y but reallyt the for  loops can be run over and over in lots of dimensions and can be throught of as a database rather than as an index. you can define something as a matrix of various dimensions and use your for loops from there
 
 
 
 #some data wrangling
colnames(npvs)=discount_rates
rownames(npvs)=damages
 npvs
 

 npvs = gather(npvs, 1:7, key=dis, value=npv)
 head(npvs)
 ggplot(npvs, aes(x=npv, col=as.factor(dis)))+geom_density(size=2)+scale_color_brewer(type="seq", name="Discount")
 #gather takes all of the discount rate column and makes them a separate column so now we have a long string of discount rate and NPV vectors. incorporates the damages into both vectors. 
 # how about summing all the damages
 npv.total =npvs %>% group_by(dis) %>% summarize(t=sum(npv))
 head(npv.total)
 #now, we have a table that says for each discount rate what are the total damages
 ggplot(npv.total, aes(dis,t, fill=dis))+geom_col() + labs(x="Discount Rate", y="Total ($)")

 #there are other loops besides for loops that we can use for other calculations. another good one to know is a while loop
```

Some other types of loops

* while
  useful for repeating until a condition is met

Example
if a metal toxin in a lake increases by 1% per year, how many years will it take for the metal level to be greater than 30 units, if toxin is current at 5 units


```{r} 

# accumulate pollutant until a threshold - how many years does it take
#have a function that we will run up until it hits our threshold(in this case, 30) then it'll stop at 30 and will spit out how long it took to get to 30. we can't use a for loop here because we don't know what the end point t will be, so we use the while loop. we tell r where to start and what the pollutant level is. then, we say our threshold. then, r will tell us what year that'll happen. the while will repeat function within brackets up until condition is true
# initial conditions
yr=0
pollutant_level = 5

# loop
while ((pollutant_level < 30) && (yr < 1000))  {
  pollutant_level[yr]= pollutant_level[yr-1]-0.01
  # increase pollutant
pollutant_level = pollutant_level + 0.01* pollutant_level 
# keep track of time
yr = yr + 1
}
#this code is wrong ask them for help
pollutant_level
yr

# while loop dangers computer cause if the pollutant will never reach the treshold it'll just go forever up until you specifically tell it to stop in the consule. you can use control c to cut yoursef out. you can end it by putting (&& END = END) in this case we coded in && (yr <1000). just make sure you always include a condition that will for sure be met
#we can generate a pollutant level matrix by sying
pollutant_level=rep(NA,1000)
#initialize the vector
#then in the function i added "pollutant_level[yr]= pollutant_level[yr-1]-0.01*" to indec the vector

```

## <span style="color:blue"> Data types </span>

All programing languages use data-types, or structures to hold information

* integer
* floating point/ real / numeric
* character 
* string

Often data types are multi-dimensional 
Some useful ones in R

* vector
* matrix
* data frame
* tibble
* factors
* lists

lists are useful cause they don't put any constraints on the data tables we are using

Programming often involves selecting and building data structures. Like the **res** matrix we built last class to hold the results from our **for** loop

Good data structures are

* as simple as possible
* easy to understand (readable names)
* easy to manipulate 
* easy to visualize

# <span style="color:blue">

# Factors <\span>

something that has different **classes** or **groups**
useful for doing calculations with categories
factors are categorical but not character data. stuff you put into classes! goot when you want to do calculations with categories

Here's an example:

First lets look at a standard numeric vector

```{r} 
a = c(1.3, 1, 4, 1.3, 22)
# compute the mean
mean(a)
```

What if **a** is a factor

What do commands like **mean** do
```{r} 
a = as.factor(a)
# compute the mean
mean(a)
#if a is a factor you can't get the mean because it means that it is categories with levels. not numbers! so the categories have no names.
#why? lets look
a




```

We can use **summary** with factors to get frequencies in each category (or âlevelâ )



```{r fishes}

# create vector of possible fish 
possible.fish = c("salmon","steelhead","shark","tuna","cod")
possible.fish = as.factor(possible.fish)

# we can use sample to simulate a random recording of catch by fisherman, lets say we pick 20 fish from the net

catch1 = sample(possible.fish, size=20, replace=T)
# because possible.fish was a factor catch1 will be a factor
summary(catch1)
mean(summary(catch1)) #told me the mean frequency of the variables
max(summary(catch1)) #told me the maximum frequency within the list
which.max(summary(catch1)) #tells us what fish is most frequently caught and what number category it is
names(which.max((summary(catch1)))) #tells us just the name of what fish was most frequetly caught
summary(catch1)
# if we want summary to be more useful - make this a factor
#now that it is a factor it groups the fish!
catch1 = as.factor(catch1)


# to quickly get frequencies of different fish and to plot 
summary(catch1)
plot(catch1, col="blue")


# we can also use summary to explore and return information about the distribution
# mean frequency of a particular type of fish
mean(summary(catch1))

# maximum frequency
max(summary(catch1))

# which fish was most frequently caught
which.max(summary(catch1))

#to get just the name 
names(which.max(summary(catch1)))

# use results for creating text
# sprintf creates a string %s mean use what ever is after the , to fill in a string
plottitle=sprintf("We like %s", names(which.max(summary(catch1))))

plot(catch1, col="blue", main=plottitle)

# you can also add numbers to the string
plottitle=sprintf("i like to eat %s \n i ate %d cod", names(which.max(summary(catch1))), max(summary(catch1)))
plot(catch1, col="blue", main=plottitle)

#this title gives us a word that depends on what fish was caught the most. SO SMART, sprintf() lets us generate a string title that'll reflect outputs of our functions.type %s then put a function immediately after, the %s will be replaced with the output of the function. then we can also do %d to subsitute in the integer number of the function.

#How do you figure out the rarest fish in our simulated ocean

# bigger challenge how would use pre-assign probabilities to different fish and then generate your ocean, hint look at help page for sample
```

# Aside **sprintf**

some useful syntax if you want to generate strings

* **%s** replace with a string
* **%d** replace with an integer value
* **%f** replace with a real value
* **%4.1f** replace with a real value with 4 digist, two after decimal. can change the numbers for however many digits you want on either side of the decimal
* **\n** add a line return


##  <span style="color:blue"> Functions with factors <\span>

Lets generate a function that makes use of categorical data
species diversity is a good example

"Simpson's Index (D) measures the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same species ""
Value is between 0 and 1, with lower values associated with *lower* diversity

See 
[Simpson Biodiversity](http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/simpsons.htm)


```{r diversity, echo=TRUE}

source("compute_simpson_index.R")
compute_simpson_index
fish <- read_csv("fish.txt")
fish[,1]

possible.fish = as.factor(c("salmon","steelhead","shark","tuna","cod"))
# simulate a random recording of catch by fisherman

count(fish)
count(fish$salmon)
# note here is answer to above challenge
catch1 = sample(possible.fish, size=10, prob = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4), replace=T)
# lets create a test case that should have low diversity, by repeating the same thing. this function will weight the chance of catching certian things (ie sharks are harder to catch than cod)
catch2 = c(rep("salmon", times=10), rep("cod", times=10))

compute_simpson_index(catch1)
compute_simpson_index(catch2)

```

What would be a useful error check here!

Repeat for the alternative Simpson Diversity Index
Test on the **fish.txt** 

Divide by zero - one of the most common errors! 

Sometimes you don't want factors and R thinks something should be
How to change back? **as.numeric** makes sense ...but



```{r, echo=TRUE}

a = as.factor(c(1.3, 1, 4, 1.3, 22))
#sum(a)

# try to make a numeric version from the factor
b = as.numeric(a)
sum(b)
b

# better
b = as.character(a)
b = as.numeric(b)
b
sum(b)
```

##  <span style="color:blue"> Returning multiple things from a function < \span >

In R, to do this we use LISTS

* Lists are the most âinformalâ data structures in R
* List are really useful for keeping track of and organizing groups of things that are not all the same
* A list could be a table where number of rows is different for each column
* A list can have numeric, character, factors all mixed together
* List are often used for returning more complex information from function (e.g. lm)

```{r introlist, echo=TRUE}

# make a list
sale = list(id=2, quality="high", contents=c("apple","cherry"), cost=c(4,5))
sale

#ways to access elements
sale$id
sale$what

# you can also access by list item number
# the [x] denotes the xth item in the list
sale[[3]]
sale[["contents"]]


# how do you get the second element in the vector that has the contents
# there are two ways


# add to a list
sale$location = "Farmers market"
sale
# or remove
sale$location = NULL
sale

# some tricky things
# correct accessing items in list
sale$cost
sale[[4]]

# works but
#sale[4]


sum(sale$cost)
sum(sale[[4]])
#sum(sale[4])

# make this a bit more complicated
# and create a market list - you have sales in each market 

# first describe the markets, what is sold there and usual price
# we will use these as parameters to simulate a day at the market
nmarkets=2
possible_fruit = list(c("cherry","apple", "banana","peach"), c("blueberry","cherry","plum"))
average_price= list( c(12,2,1,5), c(10,11,4))

market_parameters = list(possible_fruit=possible_fruit, average_price=average_price)


# create a list that will be our simulated markets
market_sim=list()

# total number of possible sales
maxsales = 4

for (i in 1:nmarkets) {
      # for each market we have possible fruit and their prices, 
      
      available_fruit = market_parameters[["possible_fruit"]][[i]]
      fruit = length(available_fruit)
      base_price = market_parameters[["average_price"]][[i]]
      # simulate n sales on that day
      nsale = sample(c(1:maxsales),1)
     
      
      # create an empty list to store result from each sale
      sale=list()
     for(j in 1:nsale) {
       
            # each sale has n types of fruit (simulated)
            ntype=sample(c(1:nfruit),1)
            # which fruit (simulated)
            purchase = sample(c(1:length(available_fruit)),ntype)
            kind = available_fruit[purchase]
            
            # how many of each fruit (simulated)
            number = sample(c(1:5),ntype)
            
            # the unit cost is the normal cost with some variation
            unitcost = rnorm(mean=1,sd=0.05,n=ntype)*base_price[purchase]
            
            # add this sale to the list of sales for that market
            sale[[j]] =list(saleid=j, kind=kind, number=number, unitcost=unitcost)
     }
      
      # repeat for each market
  market_sim[[i]]=sale
}


# look at results
market_sim[[1]]
market_sim[[2]]

# see the structure of a list
str(market)

# number of sales in market 1
length(market_sim[[1]])

# 2nd sale in the first market
market_sim[[1]][[2]]

# lapply with a function is useful for extracting one particular element
# get all the fruit sold in the first market
lapply(market_sim[[1]], function(l) l[["kind"]])
# or
lapply(market_sim[[2]], "[[","kind")


# unlist can help extract information
costperitem = unlist(lapply(market_sim[[1]], function(l) l[["unitcost"]]))
nitems = unlist(lapply(market_sim[[1]], function(l) l[["number"]]))
revenue_bysale = costperitem*nitems
sum(revenue_bysale)

# alternatively
revenue_bysale=(lapply(market_sim[[1]], function(l)  l[["number"]]*l[["unitcost"]]))
revenue_by_sale
sum(unlist(revenue_bysale))

# or even
revenue_by_sale= lapply(market_sim[[1]], function(l)  sum(l[["number"]]*l[["unitcost"]]))
revenue_by_sale
sum(unlist(revenue_by_sale))


```

So why use these complex data types?

R functions return *lists* and useful when you don't know how many rows you will need in a data frame or matrix

consider *lm*


```{r lmlist, echo=TRUE}

# read in some streamflow data
sage = read.table("sagedata.txt", header=T)
names(sage)

# sum to water year
sage_wy = str %>% group_by(wy) %>% summarize(tavg=mean(tavg), precip=sum(precip), trans=sum(trans), psn=sum(psn))

# regress photosynthesis (psn) against precip
res = lm(psn~precip+wy, data=sage_wy)
summary(res)

#lm returns a list so we can look at the different elements
str(res)
res$coefficients
res[["coefficients"]]
res[["call"]]



```

We can use *lists* to return multiple,diverse pieces of information from our functions
Lets start with diversity - many be want to know a bit more about the dataset

* Simpson diversity
* most frequent species
* number of distinct species



```{r diversitylist, echo=TRUE}

# repeat with a list
source("computediversity.R")

computediversity

computediversity(catch1)
computediversity(catch2)
```

A: Try adding to your diversity function: return the rarest species; 


B: Return two different simpson diversity equations

Note that modularity means that you should try to keep 'chunks' or pieces of code that you might re-use in separate files
Write two functions - for different simpson metrics

Then a separate functions where user decides which to use

```{r twofunct, echo=FALSE}
source("compute_simpson_index.R")
source("compute_simpson_indexB.R")

source("computediversity2.R")


```

##  <span style="color:green"> Assignment < \span >

Work in pairs

Write a function that takes as input

*a table that has prices for different fish
* a table that has the number caught for each fish
species for each location
* each location is in a different column
* each fish is in a different row 

Function output will be

* most frequently caught fish in each location
* total revenue for each location
* total fisheries revenue sum

* if user requests it graph of revenue by location and total revenue (as text)


Place your function in an *.R file

Generate some example data for your function; and show how this is created and used in an R markdown document
Submit as usual as a git link on gauchospace
